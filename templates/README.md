## Templates

This folder contains configurations for templates available for using via
**Group File Template (GFT)** [plugin for JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16836-group-file-template-gft-).

Every template has its own folder where you can find main.json (configures which
files to create and where) and some files with actual template contents to refer
them from main.json file.
